## What you should know

- What you should know to be a part of this course.
-  I've done my best to set this course so that it's approachable for pretty much anyone.
- We're going to take it right from the beginning so you don't need to have any knowledge on Git itself.
- It's also not necessary to be familiar with specific programming languages. Discourse really is about the basics, and it's about Git itself. You can do it on Windows, on Linux or Mac OS.
- The only thing that's helpful is if you are already comfortable with the command line, because we're going to do a lot of stuff from the command line. So we will not focus on code or programming languages. Most of the files we will use will be simple text files or MD files. This course also won't cover everything that get can do. What we will do is get you comfortable with the basics of git and get you to a level where you can start using Git yourself.
