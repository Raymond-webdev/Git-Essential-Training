## Use a git provider

- In the last video, we used Git locally. Now we want to push our code to a remote repository. By doing that, we can also reach it from other devices or make it available to others, to push our code, we focus on the committed fast so the ones that are in the local repository we can push those files to the remote repository by using the command, Git Push, that's all we need to do. All the files that were committed are now pushed to that remote repository. Now, let's say we are on a different device and we want to get the files that are in the remote repository to our local device or maybe we are working with a repository that other people have added code to. We use the command Git Pool, this pools all the files, not only to the local repository but also to our local folder. Now we can work with them and we will always have the latest version.

```
--------- Git push      Remote repository  ----------------------
                    https://github.com/GitRepo


--------   Git commit   Local Repository(.git) --------

--------   Git add .         Staging area       --------

---------------------       Local folder    -------------------
                         C:scripts\GitRepo\
```
