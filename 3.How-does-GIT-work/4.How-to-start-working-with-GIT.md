## How to start working with GIT

-  We've talked about the basics of Git. And now, it's time to put stuff into practice. But before we do, I want to give you a few tips. And the first one is that Git is pretty hard. People who are working with Git for a long time sometimes forget how hard it was to get started with it. Don't get discouraged. If you go in your own pace, you will get the hang of it. It's also important to know that Git has a lot of different possibilities and options. There are so many things you can do. You don't have to learn about everything before you start using Git, because you might get a bit overwhelmed.
- You can just start with some basics, like what you learn in this course. We are talking about just a fraction of all the options in this course, but it is enough to start using Git daily. Also, it might be of reassurance, that a lot of people who work with Git don't know every option, or how to deal with every problem. My advice is to get started, and if you get lost, you can find the answers you need online. With that out of the way, let's start using Git ourselves.
