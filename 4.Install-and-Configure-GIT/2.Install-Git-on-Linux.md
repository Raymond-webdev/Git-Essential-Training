## Install Git on Linux

- So, if I want to install Git on Linux I can go to the official website 
```
https://git-scm.com and then /download/linux
```
- Here, it gives me a lot of different versions of Linux and what the options are to install Git. So I can look for the OS I'm actually using and find the right command. 
- Now, when you install Ubuntu, Git is actually already installed and you can find it by saying git **--version**. Now, this is a new installation, and the Git version is actually up to date, but if you have an older installation, there's a big chance that it's out of date, and you can install the latest version by using "**sudo apt-get install git**"
