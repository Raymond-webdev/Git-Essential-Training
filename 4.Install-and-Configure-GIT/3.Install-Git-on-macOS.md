## Install Git on macOS

- Let's see how we can install Git on macOS. If you have a Mac, there's a good chance there is a version of Git on it already, but there is also a good chance that that version is out of date. You can check that by opening the Terminal and checking **git --version**. 
- If your version is out of date, you can install a new one. To do that, you can go to 
```

```
- Here it is described what options you have to download Git. The most straightforward one is to use **Homebrew**, so you install Homebrew and then use **brew install git**. After that, you can check version again to see if you have updated. 
- Another option is to use **MacPorts**, or if you are using **Xcode** as it's already using Git.
