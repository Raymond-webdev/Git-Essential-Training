Clone the remote repository

- So we have set up that remote repository. Now let's see if we can link it to our local computer so we can work on it. 
-- To do that, we click Code right here. When we click that we get a URL that we can use to clone this repository, which means that we make a local copy. 
-- We'll copy the URL and then we'll open a terminal. 
-- You can open any terminal you want. You can use PowerShell but you could use CMD as well, or the Terminal if you're on Mac or Linux. 
I have created an overall folder where I want to keep all my Git repositories, in this case, I called it Code.
-- What I'll do is type git, then clone, and then I'll paste the URL that we just copied. I'll press enter and it's now creating a new folder for this Git repository. 
- I can open it up if I want to. I'll do that in Visual Studio Code by using code and then the name of the folder, press Enter. I say I'll trust the authors as I made this file myself. And here I can find the Git repository that I had created in GitHub with the README file.
