## Create a file and stage it

- So as to see how this works, we're going to start off by creating a file and staging it. 
- Visual Studio Code is one of the best code editors because it's consistent among all operating systems, so you will always have the same experience, but if you want to, you can create the files with whatever tools you have available on your operating system.
- To create an example file we'll right click and choose New File. 
- We are going to create a file called example.txt. Note that it doesn't matter what kind of file we are creating, we could also create code in here.
- We add some content and we click Control + S to save this file. 
- We can now add this file to the staging area to make sure that Git understands that we want to save this file in the next commit. 
So we'll use **git add** and then the name of the file it now has been added to the staging area. Note that in this case, I could also have used Git add . 
- If I use that and I make changes to both the example file and the ReadMe file, they would both be added to be considered for the next commit.
