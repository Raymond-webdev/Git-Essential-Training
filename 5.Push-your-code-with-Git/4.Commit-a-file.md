## Commit a file

- In the last chapter we added a file to the staging area. If we are not sure if there are files in that area we can always check with **git status** and we see that there is a change to be committed.
- The new file is **example.txt**. Let's commit this file locally. 
- We will say, "**git commit -m**". And now we can fill out a message so we can tell whoever is viewing this history why we made a commit here or what we added. In this case, we will say, "adds example.txt". We'll press enter and our file is now committed.
 This means that locally a snapshot has been created of the state of this file. If We add **git status** now, it will say that everything's committed, but we're still ahead of the branch on the remote repository. In the next chapter we will push that file to the remote repository.
