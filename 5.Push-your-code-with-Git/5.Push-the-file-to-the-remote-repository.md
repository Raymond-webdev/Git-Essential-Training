## Push the file to the remote repository

- So we now have a file in our local repository that has not been pushed to the remote repository. If we use **git status**, we can see that our branch locally is ahead of the one remotely, and it actually tells us what we need to do. We need to use git push. 
- It has now been pushed to our remote repository. Let's see if we can find it there. So I'll open the web interface here and I'll refresh. An example.txt has been added. And we can see the message we set when we set our commit adds.example.txt.
