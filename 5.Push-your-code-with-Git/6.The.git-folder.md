## The .git folder

- So when we look at Visual Studio Code this still looks just like an ordinary folder. There's nothing here saying that this is a Git repository.
- But if we look in the Finder or the File Explorer, and we go to that folder, we see a new folder has been added: **.git**.
- In this folder are a bunch of different files and it stores everything that makes your local folder now a GitHub repository. So it stores all history and metadata, we can open it up here or we can open it in Visual Studio Code. 
We'll click the right mouse button, show more options, and use Open with Code. Here we can see what's going on in the files. The most important file for you to be aware of is the **config** file. This is where you can store configuration specific for this repository. And we can also get information here. We can look through all the other files.
- What they do is store information about the remote repository. They store logs and information about branches, for example. While you can read this outside of the config file, it's recommended to not change anything. If you change anything here, Git might stop working. If you remove this folder your repository is now again just a local folder. So while it is good to be aware of this folder exists, at this point I would say leave it be and don't change anything.
