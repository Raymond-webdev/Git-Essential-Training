## Git status

- We are now able to use Git, but there are a lot of things we can do when we interact with our files. Let's see how that all works. 
- One of the most powerful commands we have with Git is **git status**. 
- Git status will always tell you how your Git repository is doing. It will often also tell you what you might want to do to get yourself out of a situation. Let's see how that works. 

- So if I create a new file, it is added to my repository. If I now do git status, it will tell me that there's file that is untracked which means it's not in the staging area yet. It also shows me what I can do, I can use git add file to include it in what will be committed. I'll do git add example.md and I'll use git status again. And it says I do have new changes to be committed. So they have been staged, but I can commit them now. It also shows me what to do if I don't want to commit it and I want to get it back at the working area instead of the staging area.
But in this case, I'm going to commit it, so I'll commit that and now let's look at the status again. So it tells me everything locally is clean, the working tree is clean and there's nothing to be done.

- Everything is tracked but it also tells me that my local branch is ahead of the one that is remote so I can see I still have to push one commit and it tells me I can do that with git push. 
- So if I do that, the change will be pushed to my remote repository and if I use git status again, it says nothing to commit, working tree is clean and my branch is up to date. So there's nothing to be done. Git status can be really helpful to keep track of where you are, especially if you get into trouble or if you're not sure what's going on. You can always use git status to see how your repository is doing.
