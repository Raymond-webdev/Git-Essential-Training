## Revert to an old state

- So in the previous chapter, we saw how we could see all the previous versions but now let's see if we can go back to a previous version. Maybe we've added a mistake or maybe we've added a bug that we want to roll back from. 
- So first, let's see what we have in our history. I'll use **git log --oneline**, by doing that, that will only show the commit message, so it's a little bit easier to see what has happened. I can also see all the IDs that have been brought back.  So let's say that I want to go back to the stage where I didn't have a certain folder so we want to go back to the original state. I'll copy the ID of that particular folder and I'll use **git revert** and then the ID of the commit that I want to go back to. 
- And as you see, that particular folder has actually removed because in Git's mind, it didn't exist in the first place until I added that file to there. Now, one thing that's important is I'm not actually going back into history because that's considered bad practice because we want to keep track of that history and there's a big chance they're going to cause some issues if other people are also using that code.
