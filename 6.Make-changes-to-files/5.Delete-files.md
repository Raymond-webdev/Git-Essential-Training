## Delete files 

- We have already added files and made changes to existing files. But what happens if we delete a file? Let's see if I can delete example.txt. I'll press delete, say Move to Recycle Bin. I can now actually commit this change. 
- First I'll add it by using **git add .** and after that I will commit it by using **git commit -m "removes example.txt"**, and it shows now that one file was changed and everything that was in there was deleted. And the file is now gone from this interface. And if I push this by using **git push** and I look at my remote repository, I can now see that example.txt is gone. So the file is gone, but I can still keep track of it by using the commit history, like we saw in the previous video. So here I can go to the previous commits, and this one is removes example.txt. And I can still see what was part of this file. So this way I can get back the content of a file that might be deleted.
