## Look back at Git history

- We've been talking a lot about how you can use git for version control, so to keep track of older versions, but how does that actually work? How can we go back to a previous date, or a previous snapshot, or a previous commit? Let's see how that works.
- First thing I'm going to do is pull up all those old commits with git log so let's say I want to go back to a certain commit. 
- I will copy a part of the commit message. and I'll use **git checkout**, and then paste. I'm now referring back to the old version.
- In Visual Studio Code, I can always see what's going on, because I can see that I'm right here in the commit at the left bottom. Note that I don't have a working copy now, I am what we call at a detached state, which means I cannot add this to the current version, it has nothing to do with where my code is right now, so this is really helpful if you want to watch the history, if you want to see what's going on, but not if you want to make changes. I can go back by using **git checkout**, and then the name of the current branch, which will often be main. And we see my folders appearing again. So I'm now back at the state where I started. So this is a way that you can see the history of your git commits in the file that we're in there.
